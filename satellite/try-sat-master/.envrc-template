# All the resources created by try-sat will use this prefix on their name.
# Recommend you set to 'satellite-test' or similar (perhaps including your
# initials if you're on a shared account), e.g. you might use
# 'abc-my-satellite-test'.
#
# Please keep this less than 20 chars long (it will be prepended onto some
# IBM Cloud resources which have length restrictions), and just regular
# characters - no spaces. Recommend you do *not* end with a hyphen.

# OPTIONAL: You can leave these values at the default or change them if you prefer.
export LOCATION_REGION="eu-gb" # Region where the Satellite location is managed from in IBM Cloud - currently this needs to be `eu-gb` or `us-east`.
export IAAS_REGION="eu-gb"     # Region where your IaaS artifacts are created in IBM Cloud to run the location; `ibmcloud is regions` will tell you the valid regions.

# OPTIONAL: If you want to, you can uncomment the line below and tweak the VSI
# profile used for the worker nodes, which controls the Memory and CPU provided.
# 'bx2-4x16' is the minimum required for Satellite. `ibmcloud is instance-profiles`
# will list the valid values.
# export TF_VAR_WORKER_NODE_PROFILE="bx2-4x16"

# OPTIONAL: By default, `try-sat` will use the same configuration for `ibmcloud`
# as everything else on your system. This is simplest, but prevents you from
# using `ibmcloud` against other IBM Cloud accounts whilst `try-sat` is working.
# If you want to change that behaviour, uncomment this line which will create a
# separate 'home' for the `ibmcloud` CLI. If you do that, it becomes especially
# important to run `make install` as per the README to ensure you have all the
# right CLI plugins installed.
